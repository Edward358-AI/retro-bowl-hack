## About
A hack that allows you to get a large amount of coaching credits (WEB VERSIONS ONLY).

## Running it
To run this hack, open developer console (F12) and run the code in hack.js

This is currently working across all Retro Bowl versions (tested on poki as well) except for mobile. 

NOTE: If you do not have access to console, there is no way for this to work.
