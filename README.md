## About
A hack that allows you to get a large amount of coaching credits (WEB VERSIONS ONLY).

## Running it
To run this hack, open developer console (F12) and run the code in main.js if you are on the main version, college.js for if you are on retro bowl college.

This is currently working across all Retro Bowl versions (tested on poki as well) EXCEPT for mobile. 

This simple hack can also be expanded to give you draft picks, max facilities, and basically anything that is saved by Retro Bowl.

NOTE: If you do not have access to console, there is no way for this to work.
